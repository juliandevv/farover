## VSLAM and Simulation Project

This project aims to simulate a simple wheeled robot with a Lidar sensor to run a SLAM algorithm for navigation. The project template was created from Josh Newans template repo and some of the work was guided by his youtube series [Articulated Robotics](https://www.youtube.com/@ArticulatedRobotics).
